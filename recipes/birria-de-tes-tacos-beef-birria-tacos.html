    <h2>What Is Birria?</h2>
    <p>
      Birria, a.k.a. tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its braising liquid until it reaches a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Traditionally, it gets its flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.

      <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol id="directions">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the boiling water; boil for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy cast-iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over high heat. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. Add vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender. Pour in the reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat in the Dutch oven, turning the roast so it is completely covered with sauce; cover with a lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce, until birria begins to fall apart, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the lid and bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any fat from the sauce. Shred meat with two forks, then return meat to the pot and stir with the sauce to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble and heat tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria and top with Mexican cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro. Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and cheese is melted.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
